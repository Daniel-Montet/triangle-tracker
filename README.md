| For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.     | 5,5,5 | equilateral |
| For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.    | 5,5,6    |   isosceles |
| For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.| 5,6,7      |    scalene|
| if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values    | 9,4,3 | not a triangle |
